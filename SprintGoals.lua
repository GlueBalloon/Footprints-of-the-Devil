et’s review the goals for this sprint:

Please implement the following features:

1. Create a basic combat system where Neanderthal units have a strength advantage over Homo sapiens units.
2. Give Homo sapiens units a combat bonus when they flank an opponent on two or more sides.
3. Implement a simple leveling system, where surviving a battle allows a unit to level up and increase its strength.
4. This is a multiplayer-focused game with a time limit for each turn. Implement turn taking.
5. Constrain unit movement to 1 cell per turn. Only allow orthogonal moves. 

All code should be written for Codea Lua, only using the functions and features available in Codea Lua. Specifically there are no “def” statements in Codea Lua
