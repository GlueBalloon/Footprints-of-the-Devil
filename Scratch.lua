a method called execute(). This interface will be the base for all command classes.
lua
Copy code
Command = class()

function Command:init(receiver)
self.receiver = receiver
end

function Command:execute()
-- This method will be overridden in concrete command classes
end
Create concrete command classes:
For each action that a player can perform, create a concrete command class that implements the Command interface. These classes will contain the logic to execute the action.
For example, if you have a "MoveUnitCommand":

lua
Copy code
MoveUnitCommand = class(Command)

function MoveUnitCommand:init(receiver, unit, targetX, targetY)
Command.init(self, receiver)
self.unit = unit
self.targetX = targetX
self.targetY = targetY
end

function MoveUnitCommand:execute()
self.receiver:moveUnit(self.unit, self.targetX, self.targetY)
end
Create an Invoker class:
This class will be responsible for executing the commands and maintaining the history of executed commands.
lua
Copy code
Invoker = class()

function Invoker:init()
self.commandHistory = {}
end

function Invoker:executeCommand(command)
command:execute()
table.insert(self.commandHistory, command)
end
Modify your game to use the Command pattern:
Now you'll need to update your game to use commands instead of calling methods directly. Create an instance of the Invoker class and use it to execute commands.
lua
Copy code
local invoker = Invoker()

-- Instead of calling game:moveUnit(...) directly, create a command and execute it through the invoker
local moveUnitCommand = MoveUnitCommand(game, unit, targetX, targetY)
invoker:executeCommand(moveUnitCommand)
By following these steps, you can start implementing the Command pattern in your game. Remember to replace all direct method calls with command objects and execute those commands using the invoker. This will help you create a more flexible and maintainable game architecture that can handle complex features such as AI, undo/redo functionality, or multiplayer.
